# Gnzcode ðŸ‘‹

## Introduction
My name is Alexis (Gnzcode), and I'm an enthusiastic and dedicated web developer. I started my programming journey two years ago when I came up with the brilliant idea of creating a Discord bot using Node.js, despite having no prior coding experience. I encountered countless challenges along the way since I knew nothing, but soon realized that I found it enjoyable to face new obstacles.

Currently, after learning programming properly, I'm working on personal projects while preparing myself for my first professional experience in the near future.
